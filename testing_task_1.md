  def checkforAce(card) #Capital A in this method should be snake case
    if card.value = 1 #should be ==
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

  dif highest_card(card1 card2) #dif should be def needs comma between the 2 parameters
  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card               #should be card1 not card
  else
    return card2
  end
end
end                          #extra end needs removed

def self.cards_total(cards)
  total # variable needs to be assigned to a value total = 0
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total #Total should be converted to String or interpolated using #{}
  end # return should be after loop for max total of the loop
end

# needs end for the class
